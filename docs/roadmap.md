# Roadmap

*Uber Confidential Information*

We are currently focusing on visualizing XVIZ in the browser.

* **Richer Visuals** - Improvements in the underlying WebGL framework stack (deck.gl and luma.gl) are being made in preparation for richer visuals, e.g. support for loading glTF models, animated styling for geometry primitives, postprocessing effects like glow etc.


## Ecosystem Aspirations

* **UI Applications** - We expect to keep improving [streetscape.gl](https://github.com/uber/streetscape.gl) as a toolkit for XVIZ, and provide to support the ecosystem in case other open source applications emerge.

* **Base Converters from other formats** - To help new users quickly get started. (E.g. improved rosbag support.)

* **Loaders for Open Map Libraries** - We want to work with providers of open autonomy-type map data and make sure turn-key loaders are available for those data sets to serve as the backdrop for XVIZ sequences
