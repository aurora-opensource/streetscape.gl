# Streetscape.gl

*Uber Confidential Information*

streetscape.gl is a visualization framework for autonomy and robotics data encoded in the XVIZ protocol. It includes a sample reference application that lets users visualize dynamic, streamed XVIZ data. Uts roots in the [vis.gl](http://vis.gl) tech stack facilitates loading and visualization of local geospatial data such as point clouds, lane graphs and imagery, which then can then serve as the perfect visual back-drop for the dynamic XVIZ data.
