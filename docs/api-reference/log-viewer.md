# LogViewer (React Component)

Renders a 3D view of a XVIZ log.

```jsx
import {LogViewer, VIEW_MODE} from 'streetscape.gl';

<LogViewer log={log} viewMode={VIEW_MODE.TOP_DOWN} />;
```

## Properties

##### log (XVIZLoader)

The log to render - an [XVIZLoader](/docs/api-reference/xviz-loader-interface.md) object.

##### mapboxApiAccessToken (String, optional)

A [Mapbox API access token](https://www.mapbox.com).

##### mapStyle (Object|String, optional)

A [Mapbox style](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map) to render the base map with.

##### xvizStyles (Object, optional)

Override the XVIZ styles. If supplied, will be deep-merged with the styles in the log metadata.

For more information, see
[XVIZ styling specification](https://github.com/uber/xviz/blob/master/docs/protocol-schema/style-specification.md).

##### car (Object, optional)

Defines the car asset. May contain the following fields:

- `mesh` (Object|Promise) - a descriptor of the car model, usually loaded from an external file. May
  contain the following fields:

  - `indices` (Uint16Array|Uint32Array)
  - `positions` (Float32Array)
  - `normals` (Float32Array)
  - `texCoords` (Float32Array, optional)

  The x axis points from the front to the back of the car, the y axis points from the left to the
  right of the car, and the z axis is up. Unit is meters.

- `scale` (Number|[Number, Number, Number], optional) - size of the car, either an uniform scale or
  `[scale_x, scale_y, scale_z]`.
- `texture` (String, optional) - path to an image file that is the texture for the model. Default
  `null`.
- `color` (Array, optional) - RGBA value in the 0-255 range. Ignored if `texture` is present.
  Default `[128, 128, 128, 255]`.
- `origin` ([Number, Number, Number], optional) - offset of the model origin in meters. Default
  `[0, 0, 0]`.

If `car` is not specified, it defaults to a box. streetscape.gl offers utilities to quickly generate
simple, nondescript cars. See [CarMesh](/docs/api-reference/car-mesh.md).

##### streamFilter (Array|String|Object|Function, optional)

Specify which streams to render.

- String: a single stream name to be allowed.
- Array: multiple stream names to be allowed.
- Object: keys are stream names. A stream is rendered if its value is truthy.
- Function: custom callback that receives a stream name as argument and returns truthy if the stream
  should be rendered.

##### customLayers (Array, optional)

A list of additional layers to render.

```jsx
import {LogViewer} from 'streetscape.gl';
import {ScatterplotLayer} from 'deck.gl';

const customLayers = [
  new ScatterplotLayer({
    id: 'custom-scatterplot',

    // Scatterplot layer render options
    getPosition: d => d.position,
    getRadius: 1,
    getColor: [255, 0, 0],

    // log-related options
    streamName: '/tracklets/label',
    coordinate: 'vehicle_relative'
  })
];

<LogViewer log={log} customLayers={customLayers} />;
```

Each layer must be a deck.gl `Layer` instance. In addition to deck.gl's layer properties, you may
add the following props:

- `streamName` (String) - if supplied, the layer will receive the primitives from the current frame
  as `data`, and will use the stream's coordinate system as defined in the log metadata.

If `streamName` is not supplied, a custom layer is expected to bring its own data. In this case, you
may still supply these props in order to use a specific coordinate system from the current frame:

- `coordinate` (String)
- `pose` (Object)

See XVIZ's stream metadata spec for details.

##### viewMode (Enum, optional)

A value of the `VIEW_MODE` enum.

```
import {VIEW_MODE} from 'streetscape.gl';
```

- `VIEW_MODE.TOP_DOWN` - orthographic view at the car from the top.
- `VIEW_MODE.PERSPECTIVE` - perspective view at the car. Users can freely pan and rotate.
- `VIEW_MODE.DRIVER` - perspective view from the car.

##### viewState (Object, optional)

Override the internal view state. By default, `LogViewer` is a stateful component which stores the
latest camera state internally. Supply this prop if you wish to use it as a stateless component. The
value is expected to contain the following fields:

- `longitude` (Number) - longitude of the map center
- `latitude` (Number) - latitude of the map center
- `zoom` (Number)
- `pitch` (Number) - rotation in degrees
- `bearing` (Number) - rotation in degrees

##### viewOffset (Object, optional)

Override the internal view offset. By default, `LogViewer` is a stateful component which stores the
latest camera state internally. Supply these props if you wish to use it as a stateless component.
The value is expected to contain the following fields:

- `x` (Number) - horizontal offset of the tracked object (car) from the map center, in screen pixels
- `y` (Number) - vertical offset of the tracked object (car) from the map center, in screen pixels
- `bearing` (Number) - rotation of the camera relative to the heading of the car

See [Use Alternative State Manager](/docs/developer-guide/state-management.md) for examples.

##### onViewStateChange (Function, optional)

Callback when the view state changes. Will be called with the following parameters:

- `newState` (Object)
  - `state.viewState` (Object) - descriptor of the new view state.
  - `state.viewOffset` (Object) - descriptor of the new view offset.

##### onSelectObject (Function, optional)

Callback when an object is left clicked on. Will receive the following arguments:

- `info` (Object) - a descriptor of the object being clicked
- `event` (Object) - the original pointer event

If the callback returns `true`, the event is considered "handled" and prevents the default behavior
(toggle object selection).

##### onContextMenu (Function, optional)

Callback when an object is right clicked on. Will receive the following arguments:

- `info` (Object) - a descriptor of the object being clicked
- `event` (Object) - the original pointer event

##### objectStates (Object, optional)

Override the internal object states. By default, `LogViewer` is a stateful component which stores
the latest object states internally. Supply this prop if you wish to use it as a stateless
component. The value is expected to be in the following form:

```js
{
  [state_name_1]: {
    [object_id_1]: true,
    [object_id_2]: true
  },
  [state_name_2]: {
    [object_id_1]: false
  }
}
```

See [Use Alternative State Manager](/docs/developer-guide/state-management.md) for examples.

##### onObjectStateChange (Function, optional)

Callback when some object state (e.g. whether they are selected) changes. Will receive a single
parameter `objectStates`.

##### getTransformMatrix (Function, optional)

A custom function that is called if a stream's `coordinate` is `DYNAMIC`. Will receive the following
props:

- `key` (String) - key of the transform, as specified in the stream's metadata
- `context` (Object) - the current frame

Default: `() => null`

##### renderObjectLabel (Function, optional)

A custom function / React component to render the content of the popup for selected objects. Will
receive the following props:

- `id` (String) - object id
- `isSelected` (Boolean) - if object is selected
- `object`
  ([XVIZObject](https://github.com/uber/xviz/blob/master/docs/api-reference/xviz-object.md)) - the
  selected object
- `xvizStyles`
  ([XVIZStyleParser](https://github.com/uber/xviz/blob/master/docs/api-reference/xviz-style-parser.md)) -
  the XVIZ stylesheets.

Popups will be disabled if this prop is set to `false`.

Default: `(props) => props.isSelected && <div>{props.id}</div>`

##### style (Object, optional)

Custom CSS overrides. May contain the following fields:

- `objectLabelColor` (String) - color of the object labels
- `objectLabelTipSize` (Number|Function) - size of the object labels
- `objectLabelTip` (Object|Function) - the pointer on the object
- `objectLabelLine` (Object|Function) - the line connecting the object and its label
- `objectLabelBody` (Object|Function) - the body of the object label.
- `tooltip` (Object|Function) - the hover tooltip.

A custom style callback function will receive the following arguments:

- `props` (Object)
  - `theme` (Object) - the current theme
  - `isSelected` (Boolean) - if the object is selected
  - `position` (String) - position of the label relative to the object

##### showMap (Boolean, optional)

Render base map. Default is `true`.

##### showTooltip (Boolean, optional)

Render hover tooltip. Default is `false`.

##### debug (Function, optional)

Callback called once every second with debugging info. Receives the following arguments:

- `metrics` (Object)
  - `fps` (Number)
  - `redraw` (Number) - the number of times WebGLContext was rerendered
  - `frame-update` (Number) - the number of XVIZ frames rendered to screen
  - `loader-update` (Number) - the number of new XVIZ messages loaded
  - `loader-error` (Number) - the number of XVIZ errors generated during loading

### Log Info

> Advanced warning: this section is for developing customized components only.

The following props are automatically populated when the `log` prop is provided. Supply these props
manually if the component is used without a `XVIZLoader` instance, e.g. connected with a Redux
store:

##### frame (Object)

The current frame of the log.

##### metadata (Object)

The metadata of the log.
